Final Report: Outcome of the Evaluation Analysis

Scope
This report maps each evaluation criterion to the current Angular application implementation and highlights optional items and notes.

1) Login Page
- Angular Material + Bootstrap layout: Implemented. LoginComponent uses MatFormField, MatInput, MatButton, and Bootstrap grid/flex utilities. ✓
- Authenticate from local JSON: Implemented via AuthService.loadUsers() reading assets/users.json. ✓
- On success navigate to a lazy-loaded movie module: Implemented (router.navigate(['/movies'])). ✓
- Basic route guard to protect movie route: Implemented (authGuard on /movies). ✓

2) Movie Module (Lazy Loaded)
- Lazy-loaded MoviesModule: Implemented via loadChildren in app.routes.ts. ✓
- Display movies using Material cards/grid list: Implemented (MatCard + layout; MatGridListModule is imported though Bootstrap grid is primarily used). ✓
- Each movie card: Poster thumbnail, title, and a "More info"/"View Details" button: Implemented in MoviesListComponent template. ✓

3) TMDb API Integration
- Uses TMDb public API to fetch and display movies: Implemented in TmdbService (discover, search, details). ✓
- API key stored in environment file: Present in src\environments\environment.ts. ✓
- Dedicated service handles API calls: TmdbService encapsulates all HTTP calls. ✓
- Posters displayed via TMDb image base URL: Implemented through TmdbService.imageUrl. ✓

4) Movie Detail Page
- Clicking "View Details" navigates to /movies/:id: Implemented by MoviesRoutingModule. ✓
- Angular resolver fetches details before activation: Implemented (movieDetailResolver). ✓
- Detail page uses Angular Material/standard components to display title, poster, overview, release date, etc.: Implemented in MovieDetailComponent. ✓

5) TypeScript Usage
- Services use TypeScript interfaces: Implemented (UserCredential, MovieListItem, MovieDetails in shared\models.ts). ✓
- Clear interfaces for list items, details, and user credentials: Present. ✓
- Avoid any; strong typing throughout: Implemented (no any in public APIs; rare internal uses are contained). ✓

6) Interceptors (Loader, Token)
- Loader interceptor: Adds global loader for each API call and removes after response: Implemented via LoaderInterceptor + LoaderService + SpinnerComponent. ✓
- Auth token interceptor: Adds token and handles errors globally: Implemented (AuthTokenInterceptor attaches Authorization header). ✓
- 401 flow: Do not logout immediately; attempt refresh, retry request on success; on failure, logout: Implemented with mocked refreshToken in AuthService. ✓
- Mock server allowance: The refresh cycle is mocked consistently with the brief. ✓

7) Bonus (Optional)
- Search input to filter movies: Implemented in MoviesListComponent. ✓
- Shared auth service to manage auth state: Implemented (AuthService using signals + localStorage). ✓

Additional Implementations (UX/Structure Enhancements)
- Global Logout top bar visible on all routes except the login page. ✓
- Theme system with light/dark/system modes, persisted in localStorage, follows system changes via matchMedia with event listener fallback and cleanup. ✓
- Guard to forbid accessing /login when already authenticated (tokenForbiddenIfAuthenticatedGuard). ✓
- URL-synchronized filters and infinite scroll on the movie list. ✓
- NSFW filtering using genres/keywords with optional nsfwjs image classification toggle. ✓

Items for Your Decision / Optional Polishing
- TMDb API key management: Key in environment.ts is fine for the evaluation. For production, consider env variables or a backend proxy. Optional
- Material GridList vs. Bootstrap: Layout currently uses Bootstrap grid with MatCard. If you prefer explicit MatGridList usage, we can adapt. Optional
- Refresh token realism: Currently mocked. If desired, we can extend with expiry/refresh simulation or wire to a mock server. Optional

Quick Usage Notes
- Configure TMDb key: src\environments\environment.ts (tmdbApiKey).
- Run the app: ng serve (from project root).
- Demo credentials (assets\users.json): admin/admin123, user/user123, 1/1.

- Theme: src\app\shared\theme.service.ts (system theme evaluation via matchMedia and change listeners)

Final Assessment
All mandatory evaluation points are implemented and working according to the codebase. Optional enhancements are already present; production-hardening (API key handling, realistic refresh endpoint) can be addressed if required.
