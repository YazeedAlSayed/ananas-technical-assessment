Report: Evaluation of Implementation vs. Requirements

Scope note:
- The analysis is based on the code excerpts provided as the latest version during this session. Where files are not shown (e.g., environments, interceptors, users.json), items are marked as Unknown/Missing with rationale and how to confirm.

1) Login Page
Requirements:
- Angular Material form controls for login, Bootstrap layout
- Authenticate from local JSON (assets/users.json)
- On success, navigate to lazy-loaded movie module
- Route guard to protect movie route
Findings:
- Login component route exists: src/app/app.routes.ts maps path 'login' to LoginComponent. The component file exists (src/app/auth/login.component.ts), but its template/logic wasn’t reviewed here; cannot confirm Material usage or JSON-based auth. Status: Unknown/Partial.
- Route guard exists: src/app/shared/auth.guard.ts checks AuthService.token and redirects to /login if absent. Present.
- Guard application: Movies routes ('' and 'movies') are lazy-loaded without canActivate: [authGuard], so the guard is not currently applied to protect them. Partial.
- Local JSON for users (assets/users.json): Not shown. AuthService implementation details are not shown. Missing/Unknown.
Assessment:
- Present: Login route and guard implementation.
- Partial: Guard not applied to movies routes; Material/Bootstrap login form cannot be confirmed.
- Missing/Unknown: JSON-based authentication and users.json.

2) Movie Module (Lazy Loaded)
Requirements:
- Lazy-loaded movies module after login.
- Use Angular Material cards/grid list to display TMDb movies as cards with poster, title, and “View Details”.
Findings:
- Lazy loading: app.routes.ts lazy-loads MoviesModule at '' and at 'movies'. Present (note: loads regardless of auth due to missing guard on these routes).
- MoviesModule: src/app/movies/movies.module.ts imports MatCardModule, MatGridListModule, MatButtonModule, and includes MoviesListComponent and MovieDetailComponent (standalone). Present.
- UI: MoviesListComponent uses MatCard and Bootstrap grid, showing poster, title, and a “More info” (details) button. Present.
Assessment: Present.

3) TMDb API Integration
Requirements:
- Use TMDb API to fetch and display movie list.
- API key stored in environment file.
- Use a service for API calls.
- Display posters using TMDb images API.
Findings:
- Service: src/app/movies/tmdb.service.ts implements discover, search, details, and imageUrl. Present.
- Environment usage: environment.tmdbBaseUrl, tmdbApiKey, tmdbImageBaseUrl are referenced. Actual environment files not shown. Assumed present but unverified. Present (references).
- Posters: Components use tmdb.imageUrl(path) to render posters. Present.
- Extra: Simple NSFW/content filter applied. Not required but present.
Assessment: Present (with assumption on environment configuration).

4) Movie Detail Page
Requirements:
- /movies/:id route.
- Angular resolver to fetch details before activation.
- Display details (title, poster, overview, release date, etc.).
Findings:
- Routing: src/app/movies/movies-routing.module.ts defines path ':id' with resolve: { movie: movieDetailResolver }. Present.
- Resolver: src/app/movies/movie-detail.resolver.ts returns TmdbService.details(id). Present.
- UI: src/app/movies/movie-detail.component.ts displays poster, title, overview, release date, runtime, rating, genres; includes a back button. Present.
Assessment: Present.

5) TypeScript Usage
Requirements:
- Strong typing for services and data models; avoid any.
- Define interfaces for list items, details, and user credentials.
Findings:
- Movies domain: MovieListItem and MovieDetails interfaces are used across service and components. Present.
- any usage: A few any casts exist for query param parsing in MoviesListComponent; overall typing is strong. Partial but acceptable.
- User credentials interface: Not shown; AuthService content not reviewed. Unknown.
Assessment: Present for movie data; Unknown for user typing; minor any usage noted.

6) Interceptors (Loader, Token)
Requirements:
- Loader interceptor to show/hide global loader per request.
- Auth token interceptor to inject token and handle 401 with refresh flow (mock acceptable).
Findings:
- Spinner component exists and is included in app.component template (<app-spinner>) but no HttpInterceptor files or providers were shown. Unknown/Missing.
- No evidence of auth token interceptor or refresh logic registration. Missing/Unknown.
Assessment: Likely Missing.

7) Bonus (Optional)
- Search input to filter movies: Present (MoviesListComponent has search and queryParam sync).
- Shared auth.service.ts to manage auth state: File exists; behavior unverified. Marked Present (exists) but details Unknown.

Evaluation Criteria Summary
- Code structure and cleanliness: Good modularization and separation (services, resolver, state service). Present.
- Angular features: Lazy loading (Present), services (Present), routing (Present), guards (Present but not applied to routes), resolvers (Present).
- TypeScript: Strong for movies; minor any; user typing unknown.
- Angular Material + Bootstrap: Material components and Bootstrap grid utilities used. Present.
- Working login/auth flow: Cannot confirm end-to-end; guard not applied to movies routes; users.json and concrete auth flow unknown. Partial/Missing.
- Responsive and visually pleasant UI: Present (grid layout, cards, responsive columns).
- Proper usage of interceptors: Not evidenced. Missing.
- Proper error handling: Basic error messages in list/search; resolver-based fetch for details. Partial.

Recommendations to reach full compliance
- Apply authGuard to movies routes (either in MoviesRoutingModule or in app.routes for the lazy paths). Consider redirecting unauthenticated default route to /login.
- Ensure LoginComponent uses Angular Material form-field/input/button with Bootstrap layout; load credentials from assets/users.json (create file) and validate. Define a Credentials interface.
- Implement AuthService storage of token/state with localStorage; add a mock refreshToken() for 401 flows if you add auth interceptor.
- Add LoaderInterceptor to toggle SpinnerService on request start/finish; handle concurrent requests robustly.
- Add AuthTokenInterceptor to attach Authorization header when token exists; on 401, attempt refresh and retry; on failure, logout.
- Verify environment files contain tmdbBaseUrl, tmdbApiKey, tmdbImageBaseUrl, and are provided in all builds.
- Reduce any casts by narrowing types for query param handling; add explicit typing for user credentials.
